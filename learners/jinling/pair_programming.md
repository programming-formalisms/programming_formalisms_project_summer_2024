Questions:

1.What is pair programming?
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together. The goal of agile software development is to deliver software on an ongoing basis so the results can be evaluated more easily. In pair programming, one person is the “driver,” and the other is the “navigator.” The driver is the person at the keyboard who’s actively writing code. The navigator observes, checks code for accuracy, and keeps an eye on the bigger picture.

2.How does a good pair behave? Describe what can 
be observed when pairing online
Knowledge sharing:
Thanking: having another programmer to bounce ideas off of and brainstorm with is invaluable
Focus:It’s easy for your mind to wander when you’re working on your own. Having another person with you and changing roles often can help keep you fresh and focused.
Accuracy: Having someone quality checking the code as it’s being written will improve accuracy. Issues and bugs can be caught immediately rather than down the road when it’s harder to debug.

3.When to switch roles? Give a procedure
when one person unfocused, change.
