| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Acceptance Criteria | Test Cases |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| R1 | Bacteria seetings | The program must be able to handle the following input: Starting coordinates for the bacteria, initial direction and speed.|NA|
| R2 | Nutrient settings | The program must be able to handle the input: Concentration of nutrients over the surface.|NA|
| R3 | State | The program must be able to determine if the simulated bacteria is in tumble or run state. |NA|
| R4 | Run speed | If in run state the program should be able to give us the run speed based on the concentration of nutrients given for the current coordinates.|NA|
| R5 | Randomize direction| If in tumble state the program should be able to return the angle of direction. |NA|
| R6 | Time integration | Update position and speed.|NA|
| R7 | Raw coordinate output | For each pre-defined timestep the program should be able to return the x- and y-coordinate of the bacteria on the surface.|NA|
| R8 | Visualize coordinates in figure |NA|NA|
