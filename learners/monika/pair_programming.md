## What is pair programming?
- Two programmers working on the same workstation. Driver (writing code) and the navigator (observe and check). We change roles often and discuss the plan and the solution often.
## How does a good pair behave? Describe what can be observed when pairing online
- Communicate clearly. Switch roles in regular interval. Give the driver time to think before you step in as a navigator. Communication might be challenging on-line.
## When to switch roles? Give a procedure
- Regular.
## What effects does pair programming have?
- Reduced turn-around-time. Higher quality code.
