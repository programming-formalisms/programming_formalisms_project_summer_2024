| ID | Description | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Display visualization in 2D, showing both the bacteria position and the nutrient distribution | Program must opens a graphical windows where the nutrient gradient and the bacteria are identiable|
| R2 | Display the bacteria trajectory | Bacteria must be easily identiable and able to continously be followed |
| R3 | Mechanics of bateria movement | Two types of bacteria movement must be designed |
| R4 | Bacteria must be able to sense the nutrient gradient | When bacteria moves to aerea with nutrients it should switch its movement|
| R5 | Determine the bacteria direction when interact with nutrient | Check if bacteria changes direction when interact with nutrient|
