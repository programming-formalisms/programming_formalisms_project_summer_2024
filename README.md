The Programming Formalisms project of summer 2024.

## Goal

To simulate bacterial movement in 2D space.

One way to model bacterial movement is 
the run and tumble model,
where 'run' is going straight in a direction,
and 'tumble' is picking a random direction.
The 'run' lasts longer when a bacterium
finds more and more nutrients (e.g. dissolved
sugars), and lasts shorter
when finding less and less nutrients.
